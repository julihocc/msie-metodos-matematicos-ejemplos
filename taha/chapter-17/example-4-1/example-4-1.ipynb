    "An **ergodic Markov chain** is a type of Markov chain in which all states are both **recurrent** and **aperiodic**. In an ergodic chain, the chain is **irreducible**, meaning each state is accessible from every other state, allowing it to eventually reach any part of its state space from any initial position. Additionally, since it is aperiodic, the chain lacks a fixed cycle of visits, ensuring that transitions do not occur at regular intervals or periods. This condition guarantees convergence to a unique **steady-state distribution** that is independent of the initial state distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, ergodicity implies that, over time, the Markov chain reaches a stable long-term distribution of states. This **steady-state distribution** allows us to predict the proportion of time the process will spend in each state as the number of transitions approaches infinity."

    "1. **Irreducibility**: The Markov chain must be irreducible, meaning it is possible to reach any state from any other state within the chain (though it may require multiple steps). This ensures that no state is isolated, allowing all states to be part of a single communicating class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aperiodicity**: The chain must be aperiodic, meaning that there are no fixed intervals at which states are revisited. Formally, the greatest common divisor of the number of steps required to return to any state must be one. This prevents the chain from cycling between states in regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Positive Recurrence**: Every state in the chain must be positively recurrent, meaning that the expected time to return to each state is finite. This ensures that the chain does not wander indefinitely without revisiting states.\n",

    "To determine if a matrix represents an ergodic Markov chain, follow these steps:\n",

    "1. **Check for Irreducibility**:\n",
    "   - Verify that every state is reachable from every other state. In terms of the matrix $P$, this means that for any pair of states $i$ and $j$, there exists some integer $n$ such that $(P^n)_{ij} > 0$. This indicates that state $i$ can eventually reach state $j$ with non-zero probability.\n",
    "   - Practically, this can be checked by confirming that the matrix $P$ raised to a sufficiently large power (e.g., $P^n$, where $n$ is the number of states) has all positive entries in at least one power. If this is true, the chain is irreducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Aperiodicity**:\n",
    "   - A chain is aperiodic if each state does not have a fixed cycle length. This condition holds if there exists an integer $n$ such that for all states $i$, $(P^n)_{ii} > 0$, meaning that every state has a non-zero probability of returning to itself in a variety of step counts.\n",
    "   - To test this, look for the smallest $n$ such that all diagonal entries in $P^n$ are positive. If such an $n$ exists, the chain is aperiodic.\n",

    "3. **Verify Positive Recurrence**:\n",
    "   - Positive recurrence is generally assumed for finite-state irreducible Markov chains, as all states will inherently be recurrent and have finite mean return times. For finite-state chains, if steps 1 and 2 are satisfied, positive recurrence is usually guaranteed.\n",
